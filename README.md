# MetaToken README

MetaToken is a simple ERC20-compatible token smart contract developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation, transfer, and burning of tokens.

## Overview

MetaToken offers basic token functionalities, including:

- Minting new tokens.
- Burning tokens.
- Transferring tokens between addresses.

## Features

### Token Properties

- **Token Name**: "MetaToken"
- **Token Abbreviation**: "MTK"

### Total Supply Tracking

The contract keeps track of the total token supply.

### Token Balance Mapping

A mapping is used to associate token balances with Ethereum addresses.

### Minting Tokens

Tokens can be minted by anyone with permission to interact with the contract. The minting function increases the total supply and adds tokens to the balance of the designated address.

### Burning Tokens

Tokens can be burned, reducing the total supply and removing tokens from the balance of the specified address. Only the owner of the tokens can initiate a burn operation.

### Transferring Tokens

Users can transfer tokens to other addresses. Transfers are subject to balance verification to ensure that the sender has sufficient tokens.

## Usage

### Deployment

Deploy the MetaToken contract to the Ethereum blockchain, specifying the initial parameters such as the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.

### Interacting with the Contract

Users can interact with the MetaToken contract using Ethereum-compatible interfaces such as web3.js, ethers.js, or through Ethereum wallet applications like MetaMask.

#### Minting Tokens

Call the `mint` function to mint new tokens, specifying the recipient address and the amount of tokens to be minted.

#### Burning Tokens

Call the `burn` function to burn tokens, reducing the total supply and the balance of the specified address.

#### Transferring Tokens

Transfer tokens between addresses by calling the `transfer` function, providing the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to transfer.

### Security Considerations

Ensure that you review the contract source code and understand its functionalities before interacting with it. Be cautious when minting, burning, or transferring tokens to prevent unauthorized operations.
